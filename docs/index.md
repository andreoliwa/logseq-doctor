!!! note "Project Status"
This project is still in alpha, so it's very rough on the edges (documentation and feature-wise).

    At the moment, it has both a Python and Go CLI.

    The long-term plan is to convert it to Go and slowly remove Python.
    New features will be added to the Go CLI only.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of Logseq Doctor is to make it easier to migrate existing Markdown content into Logseq. Whether you're coming from another note-taking system or have a collection of flat Markdown files, Logseq Doctor helps ensure your content is properly formatted for Logseq's outliner-based structure.
